When the user asks to play a station:
1) Call find_station with the userâ€™s query and country if given.
2) Pick the best candidate. If its url looks like a playlist, call get_playable_stream.
3) Call play(url=<resolved or station url>, backend="auto").
If the user explicitly asks for VLC, call play with backend="vlc".
